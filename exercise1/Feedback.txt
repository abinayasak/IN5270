Feedback on mandatory exercise 1 for IN5270:

I think that you have done a good job with this exercise and everything looks fine to me.

Your report is easy and understandable to read and you have included enough of the
mathematical steps so that it is possible to follow the derivations.

Your code also looks pretty clean and easy to read, with a good use of functions and comments.
The results also seem correct to my eye. I got the same values for the residuals and about
the same error in the numerical solution.
So good job!
