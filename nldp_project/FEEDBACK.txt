Feedback by Alexander Sexton


Report:
- Well explained derivation of the variational form of the problem and the Picard iteration process.
- Good explanation of the verification of the implementation. All the tests seem to give reasonable results.

Code:
- The PDE problem looks to be correctly implemented in code, and all the test cases give the expected results.

All in all very good :)
