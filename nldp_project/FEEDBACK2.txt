# Feedback on diffusion project

Good and thorough explanation of the formulas and methods; everythin looks
correct! As far as I can see the implementation is good and produces nice
results.

All in all a very good report, with great structure and presentation of the
results. Very nice that you included figures. The code is also well structured
and understandable.
